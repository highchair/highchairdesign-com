Wow. Love this article so much. Long read, but full of humor and biting observation.

> To position yourself as the arbiter of a reality that is right in front of you, and to reject that reality simply because you don’t get it, to infer that the vast sea of human knowledge on the topic is nothing next to the thimble of your ignorant skepticism, to demand that the giants of human awareness who have come before you and upon whose shoulders you are invited to stand must instead stand on your shoulders, and if you cannot bear the weight, or if this does not afford you a better view than you had before, then this is proof not of your failure, but of theirs.

Basically, the phenomenon of someone not believing what they are literally seeing in front of them and acting like that is normal has been observed and skewered. The lack of curiosity and humility is astounding.
