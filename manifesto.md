## It took me 8 years to launch this site

To be clear, I didn‘t put 8 years of effort into it, but I started and stopped too 
many times. I was distracted by design ideas, passing fads, trends, and new ways 
to use the latest tech to deliver an interesting experience. I switched CMSs. 
I went to no CMS. I got stuck chasing ideas. I was trying to make this website 
*perfect*. And we all should know:

> Perfection is the enemy of done

– <small>*Someone smart who presumably finished things*</small>

## So why did I stop/start here?

I decided to do a non-design, or rather, to leverage HTML and a minimal amount 
of CSS to concentrate on the content. HTML gives us great power without much work 
— isn't it better to use for what it does best? 

What did I get without much effort?

+ Semantic meaning from well-formed and thoughtful markup
+ Accessibility
+ Responsiveness
+ Small file sizes and quick downloads (when we keep things simple)
+ Progressive enhancement & backwards compatibility

What did I avoid? 

+ No CSS reset
+ No CSS or HTML framework
+ No jQuery or JS library — No JS at all
+ No browser-specific hacks
+ No web fonts

Geeky things:

+ Only <samp>{{ site.css_kb }}</samp> of CSS
* This page has a <samp>125kb</samp> payload
+ Static HTML built with [Jekyll](//jekyllrb.com)
+ HTML-agnostic content created with mostly Markdown (via [kramdown](//kramdown.gettalong.org))

## A web for Everyone

My corner of the web is a minuscule part of a vast universe, but it is still 
mine and I still care about the people that might find it. By keeping the footprint 
of this site small, I hope the content will load quick in situations where connections 
are less than ideal, I hope the accessibility of HTML can shine because I am using 
best practices for semantic markup, and I hope that the reader feels the power to 
make my content appear in the manner that they prefer. I make very few assumptions 
for aesthetics that can't be overridden by someone who needs bigger type or more 
contrast. 

## Plans for the Future

I don't plan to be design agnostic forever. Instead, I plan to experiment and have 
fun with CSS and JS on a case-by-case basis. The blog will start simple, but when 
I feel that an article deserves some special attention, I will design it as a one 
off. No hard-and-fast system, but instead a chance to _design to the content_. 

I'm excited about it.

## _Inspiration_

Thanks to the following authors/sites:

+ [Front-end development is a Skill](//css-tricks.com/front-end-development-is-not-a-problem-to-be-solved/), where the author laments the overuse of frameworks and encourages new front-end wizards to dig into HTML and CSS instead of the latest framework. 
+ [Quartz: There’s already a blueprint for a more accessible internet](//qz.com/1407450/theres-already-a-blueprint-for-a-more-accessible-internet/), where the author makes some similar points to some of the ones I made in blog posts for Oomph, but the site design itself does not pass some A11Y requirements. 
+ [How to Build a Low Tech Website (running on Solar Power)](//solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/09/how-to-build-a-lowtech-website.html), where the LowTech blog builds a static version of itself completely solar powered, with no ads, no cookies, no tracking. The website sometimes goes offline, and the interface exposes the current battery power level as part of the design. 
+ [The Rise of Green UX](//www.fastcompany.com/90167803/the-rise-of-green-ux title="Read on FastCompany.com"), where the idea is to reduce global data/energy consumption by creating and facilitating lighter web pages that consume fewer CPU clock ticks and less bandwidth
+ [The Bullshit Web](//pxlnv.com/blog/bullshit-web title="Read on Nick Heer's personal blog"), where the author gripes about the bloat of the web, and how wider roads doesn't mean less traffic
+ [The Web is Made of Edge Cases](//codepen.io/tigt/post/the-web-is-made-of-edge-cases title="Read on Codepen.io"), where the author reinforces the facts of the web — users change default browser settings, users zoom the page, javascript fails, browser decide when to stop a render, and most sites ignore the realities of the world wide web
+ [This is a Motherf***ing Website](//motherfuckingwebsite.com), where the simplicity of HTML is celebrated with profanity
