<p>I believe in URLs, HTML, and the bits we have created.<br />
  I believe form follows function, and design should follow content.<br />
  I believe we all have a story to tell.</p>

<h2>What I do</h2>

<p>I am a human living in Providence, RI and I design and build for the web.<br />
  I design for you and the story you want to tell. I do it so that you can find your audience.<br />
  I'd like to help you tell the world, or at least a small intimate corner of it.</p>

<h2>When I do it</h2>

<p>I am available to talk about new projects through <a href="https://www.oomphinc.com/our-people/j-hogue/">Oomph, Inc.</a> 
and in a very, very limited capacity for former clients of Highchair designhaus.</p>

<h2>Least Asked Questions</h2>

<details>
  <summary>
    When did you start being a designer?
  </summary>
  <p>I consider graduation year the beginning of my career, as I was lucky to have an internship during my senior year. That was 1997, almost 30 years ago. I have been designing for the web since 2005. I am a self-taught coder but a graphic designer by education, just before digital design became <em>the</em> thing that designers do.</p>

  <summary>
    Do you have any hobbies that are not design-related?
  </summary>
  <p>Barely. I like to take photos, I like to research local architecture, but that is a design-related website I run called <a href="https://www.artinruins.com/">ArtInRuins.com</a>. I read some, I watch some. I have a letterpress I need to use more, but that is also design-related. I like to dad, to BBQ meats, and to skateboard.</p>

    How long can you hold your breath?
  </summary>
  <p>Quite a long time, according to me. I think I have a higher than average lung capacity because I played a wind instrument for several years as a teen. How nice of you to ask.</p>
