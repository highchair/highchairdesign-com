html-title: J. Hogue is Highchair designhaus
title: <code>Hello World</code>
---

I believe in URLs, HTML, and the bits we have created.  
I believe form follows function, and design should follow content.  
I believe we all have a story to tell, but not everyone wants to hear it.

## My name is J. Hogue. 
I am a human living in Providence, RI.  
I design and build for the web. 

I do it for you and the story you want to tell.  
I do it so that you can find an audience to hear it. 

I'd like to help you tell the world, or at least a small intimate corner of it. 

I am available to talk about new projects through [Oomph, Inc.](//www.oomphinc.com/our-people/j-hogue/) 
and in a very, very limited capacity for former clients of Highchair designhaus.
