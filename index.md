html-title: J. Hogue is Highchair designhaus
title: Hello World
---

## My name is J. Hogue

I believe in URLs, HTML, and the bits we have created.

I believe form follows function, and design should follow content.

I believe we all have a story to tell, but not everyone will hear it.

## What I do

I am a human living in Providence, RI and I design and build for the web.

I do it for you and the story you want to tell. I do it so that you can find an audience to hear it. 

I'd like to help you tell the world, or at least a small intimate corner of it. 

## When I do it

I am available to talk about new projects through [Oomph, Inc.](https://www.oomphinc.com/our-people/j-hogue/) 
and in a very, very limited capacity for former clients of Highchair designhaus.

## Least Asked Questions

<details>
  <summary>
    How long have you been a designer?
  </summary>
  <p>I consider graduation year the beginning of my career, as I was lucky to have an internship during my senior year. That was 1997, almost 30 years ago. I have been designing for the web since 2005. I am a self-taught coder but a graphic designer by education, just before digital design became _the_ thing that designers do.</p>

    Do you have any hobbies that are not design-related?
  </summary>
  <p>Barely. I like to take photos, I like to research local architecture, but that is a design-related website I run called [ArtInRuins.com](https://www.artinruins.com). I read some, I watch some. I have a letterpress I need to use more, but that is also design-related. I like to dad, to BBQ meats, and to skateboard.</p>

    How long can you hold your breath?
  </summary>
  <p>Quite a long time, according to me. I have higher than average lung capacity because I played a wind instrument as a kid. How nice of you to ask.</p>
