It has been cold, cold, cold for more than a month now. Feels like ever since New Year’s day, we have been under freezing. Nights are in the teens, low twenties and days barely break over 32°.

We have had more snow than usual, but not a lot of snow overall. A few inches here and there. Much of it is frozen in place now, as again, things are very cold and icy.

Kentucky has had snow and mudslides from all the rain and melting snow. The polar vortex has been wrecking havoc on the midwest.
