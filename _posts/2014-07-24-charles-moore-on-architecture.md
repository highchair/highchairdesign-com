I like to compare web design to architecture. I think it is an apt metaphor and will expand upon that idea later in a full article. For now, though, I'd like to share a quote from Mark Simon about the architect and teacher Charles Moore (my replacements in brackets):

> Charles Moore taught me too many lessons to list all of them now, but here are a few of the most important:
> > Listen carefully to your client. Don't assume that you know what they want.
> > You can give a client just what they want and still make an interesting and beautiful_ ~~building~~ <mark>website</mark> _if you use their vision as your inspiration.
> > There is no such thing as a perfect design. However, there is a substantial difference between good and bad.
> > There can be multiple good solutions to the same problem.
> > [...] Even a master has to discard many bad ideas before finding a good one.
> > Don't be afraid to collaborate. Share credit.
> > Dress conservatively to sell a radical design.
