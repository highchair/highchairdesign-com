Saw a 94% total eclipse today. Ran around like mad yesterday to find a pair of glasses. Finally found some this morning.

I expected it to get darker for some reason. Have I experienced an eclipse before? Without the glasses, you might not have known that anything was happening to the sun. I saw people on Instagram later use objects to see the eclipse — the holes in a colander became refractions of little mini eclipses.

The quality of light was interesting and difficult to describe. It was like early morning light, but brighter and overhead, so the shadows were not long. There was something shallow about the light.

We stood outside on a bright, sunny, 60 degree spring day and stared up at the sun. People tried to take photos. My lens could not see the eclipse, even if I tried to put the strong sunglasses over the lens. We stood outside for about 30 minutes and then went back inside. Totality was about 3:30pm.
