Mobile is not really a thing. As much as we talk about it, what we are really 
discussing is the way in which users of websites are freer than ever to use a 
wide array of devices to connect to the internet and interact with content. 
Mobile means that the user is more mobile than ever, free to use a smartphone 
during their daily commute, laptop or desktop at work, and iPad on the couch to 
interact with your content. Its our job to make sure that each of those 
experiences are thought about. 

Not convinced? The great Thomas Baekdal breaks down “The Mobile Shift” in [People No Longer Decide What Device They Use](//www.baekdal.com/insights/people-no-longer-decide-what-device-they-use) and [Defining a Market in The Connected World. You Are Not in Kansas Anymore!](//www.baekdal.com/insights/defining-a-market-in-the-connected-world-you-are-not-in-kansas-anymore). For the lazy, let me paraphrase with a quote:

> Mobile is not a thing, and it's not a device. It's you and me. We, as people, have become mobile, meaning that we no longer put ourself into a consumption mode. Just as we are now global by default (not restricted to a single country), we are now mobile by default as well. We are no longer just using one device; we use whatever device that happens to be near us at that moment.

I wrote this in 2012, and am republishing it because I find it interesting as a 
historical artifact — this is what we were concerned about 4 years after the iPhone 
made web design a lot more complicated. Now we take this kind of thinking for 
granted, or at least, we are not asking the same types of questions because the 
world and people’s expectations have shifted.
