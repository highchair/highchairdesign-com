There must be something in the air. [My Manifesto]({% link _posts/2018-09-04-manifesto-continued.md %}) was a revelation for me — it gave me very good reason to launch a personal website that most designers would call unfinished, or at least unfinished-looking.

Now Mat Marquis has written a new tome for the *A Book Apart* series [titled simply “Image Performance”](https://abookapart.com/products/image-performance) which I am sure is anything but simple. His one page on the book and the impetus behind it feels familiar, but better articulated:

  <blockquote class="quote" cite="https://matmarquis.com/">
    <p>Below the surface — that’s where the meaning is. To build a page that can be easily parsed by assistive technologies is to contribute to a more inclusive web; to render a page more performantly is to broaden the web’s reach. To think too shallowly about a project means nudging the larger web in the same direction: toward something meant not for all, but for some; toward something meant only for those who experience it the way we do.</p>

I like to think this might be a trend that I happen to be jumping upon. A very positive one.
