It is November 7th, and yet the past few days have been over 70°. This year’s Halloween was unseasonably warm in the 60s. Many more people were out and about because of it.

This weekend was cooler though sunny. I wore gloves a few days last week and even wrapped a blanket around my legs, as I am wont to do.

But these past three days I have opened the window to let the warm air in.
