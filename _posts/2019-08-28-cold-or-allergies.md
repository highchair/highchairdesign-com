Its the end of August and the weather has been usually cool — mid 60s to low 70s. My throat feels like I maybe have a cold? It could also be allergies, though. That’s why I am writing this down. I have no itchy eyes, no other symptoms other than post-nasal drip and a sore throat (from the drip). I don’t feel tired other than I work too much and always seem to wake up early no matter how tired I am. Different issues.
