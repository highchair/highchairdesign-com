  <blockquote class="quote" cite="https://blog.andyhume.net/responsive-by-default/">
    <p>If you think about it, responsive layout is not a new thing. Open a simple <span class="abbr">HTML</span> file in a web browser, and the content automatically adapts to fit the width of that browser. The web is responsive on its own — by default. It’s [the designer] that's been breaking it all these years by placing content in fixed-width containers.</p>
