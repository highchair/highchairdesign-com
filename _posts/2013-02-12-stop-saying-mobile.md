> ‘Mobile’ isn’t synonymous with small screens anymore. 
>
> Smartphones are getting bigger. Tablets are getting smaller. 
>
> Some smartphones have a resolution of 800px, some tablets upto 1280px. These are ‘Mobile devices’, yet most people would say a 1280px screen sits firmly in the desktop camp.
>
> Mobile was a useful term when it was new and niche. You could use it in a conversation to narrow things down. Now it’s so broad it’s fast becoming meaningless.
>
> Mobile Users will become ‘Users’, Mobile Web will become ‘Web’ and they’ll be so many devices in so many sizes that deciding what to ring fence as a Mobile device will become impossible. I’d argue that it already is.

<aside class="archive__statement">
I wrote this in 2013, and am keeping it published it because I find it interesting as a 
historical artifact — this is what we were concerned about 4 years after the iPhone 
made web design a lot more complicated. Most of the core points here are still true, 
but the App examples are out of date.
