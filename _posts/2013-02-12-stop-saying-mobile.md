<aside class="archive__statement">
I wrote this in 2013, and am keeping it published it because I find it interesting as a historical artifact — this is what we were concerned about 4 years after the iPhone made web design a lot more complicated.

  <blockquote class="quote" cite="https://jimramsden.com/notes/no-more-mobile">
    <p>‘Mobile’ isn’t synonymous with small screens anymore.</p>
    <p>Smartphones are getting bigger. Tablets are getting smaller.</p>
    <p>Some smartphones have a resolution of 800px, some tablets up to 1280px. These are ‘Mobile devices’, yet most people would say a 1280px screen sits firmly in the desktop camp.</p>
    <p>Mobile was a useful term when it was new and niche. You could use it in a conversation to narrow things down. Now it’s so broad it’s fast becoming meaningless.</p>
    <p>Mobile Users will become ‘Users’, Mobile Web will become ‘Web’ and they’ll be so many devices in so many sizes that deciding what to ring fence as a Mobile device will become impossible. I’d argue that it already is.</p>
